But on the inside, it is fabulous. The rooms are nice, I don't remember the one we stayed in but I remember paying a hell lot (almost 14,000) and the room wasn't even that lavish. It is way too over priced. The buffet dinner and breakfast was okay, nothing great, a lot of variety but the taste was pretty bland, not praise worthy. The library is really nice though. And they even have a collection of DVDs, which you can take to your room and watch. I liked this facility a lot.\nI think you could try other hotels if you're ready to pay this much! You could stay here if you happen to find some good deals and get it for cheaper rates. Totally not worth paying this much though.",

But on the inside, it is fabulous. The rooms are nice, I don't remember the one we stayed in but I remember paying a hell lot (almost 14,000) and the room wasn't even that lavish. It is way too over priced. The buffet dinner and breakfast was okay, nothing great, a lot of variety but the taste was pretty bland, not praise worthy. The library is really nice though. And they even have a collection of DVDs, which you can take to your room and watch. I liked this facility a lot.\nI think you could try other hotels if you're ready to pay this much! You could stay here if you happen to find some good deals and get it for cheaper rates. Totally not worth paying this much though.",

Things that can be improved significantly is a) the wifi connection as it is very patchy and not at all reliable. b) The bathroom hot water supply is via a single unit of Geyser hence inadequate if you are staying at the property in winter. Overall lots of entertainment and activity is arranged by the property and evenings are quite buzzing.   ",

Location is unbeatable just a short walk to a wonderful observation point of the Himalayan mountain range and also the mall area full of locap merchants and shops.  This location is also away from the congested and polluted downtown area.  \nService was impeccable, from a wonderful welcoming with tea and cookies to lightimg the fireplace in the room anytime requested. Also appreciated was complimentary unlimited bottled water and tea/snacks.  They helped arrange our tiger hill transport, airport transports and a half day tour -- certainly if trying to save money can do these on your own own but we knew it would be done well through the hotel.\nResort grounds were very well maintained with gorgeous flowers abundant.\nBreakfast and dinners were delicious, with both indian and western items available.  The weakness was baked goods and desserts which wouldnt measure up to a standard western palate, but there was plenty to choose from.\nOnly other minor complaint was cold rooms but this was easily remedied with room heater and fireplace.\n\nOverall this was magical stay for us and would hoghly recommend to anyone able to stay at the property.",

The best part of the stay was the staff which was helpful and on the toes. Special mention for the service staff at the buffet restaurant and the spa. Things that can be improved significantly is a) the wifi connection as it is very patchy and not at all reliable. b) The bathroom hot water supply is via a single unit of Geyser hence inadequate if you are staying at the property in winter. Overall lots of entertainment and activity is arranged by the property and evenings are quite buzzing.   ",

Location is unbeatable just a short walk to a wonderful observation point of the Himalayan mountain range and also the mall area full of locap merchants and shops.  This location is also away from the congested and polluted downtown area.  \nService was impeccable, from a wonderful welcoming with tea and cookies to lightimg the fireplace in the room anytime requested. Also appreciated was complimentary unlimited bottled water and tea/snacks.  They helped arrange our tiger hill transport, airport transports and a half day tour -- certainly if trying to save money can do these on your own own but we knew it would be done well through the hotel.\nResort grounds were very well maintained with gorgeous flowers abundant.\nBreakfast and dinners were delicious, with both indian and western items available.  The weakness was baked goods and desserts which wouldnt measure up to a standard western palate, but there was plenty to choose from.\nOnly other minor complaint was cold rooms but this was easily remedied with room heater and fireplace.\n\nOverall this was magical stay for us and would hoghly recommend to anyone able to stay at the property.",
